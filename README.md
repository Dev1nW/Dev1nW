### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Devin!

I'm a **Machine Learning Researcher** with the **Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP)**. With over three years of combined professional and academic research experience, I specialize in investigating the emergent capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in interactive environments (like Atari!), alongside expertise in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, specifically **Rating-based RL (RbRL)**. My focus is on leveraging human insights to enhance AI system learning and alignment.
