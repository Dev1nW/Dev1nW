### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Devin!

I'm a **Machine Learning Researcher** with the **Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP)**. With over three years of combined professional and academic research experience, I specialize in investigating the emergent capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in interactive environments (like Atari!), alongside expertise in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, specifically **Rating-based RL (RbRL)**. My focus is on leveraging human insights to enhance AI system learning and alignment.

### ðŸ”­ Research Interests

*   **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Alignment**: Specifically focusing on using ratings, as in [Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16348).
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Exploring emergent capabilities, agentic behavior, and applications, including using LLMs in playing Atari games, as in [Atari-GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15950).
*   **Human-AI Interaction**: Designing and studying systems where human input guides AI learning.
