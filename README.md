- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin. A Machine Learning Research Fellow for the Army Educational Outreach Program.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI Alignment using Human Feedback (specifically using [Ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16348)) and Natural Language Processesing (in progress).
- ðŸ“š I have previously done work on [Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16348) and [Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Optimal Time-constrained Intercept Guidance](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-2206).
