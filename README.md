### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Devin! 
I'm a Machine Learning Research Fellow with the **Army Educational Outreach Program**.

### ðŸ‘€ My Interests:
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Alignment**: Specifically focusing on using ratings, as in [Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16348).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Iâ€™m actively exploring new research, including the use of LLMs (Large Language Models) in playing Atari games, as in [Atari-GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15950).

### ðŸ“š Recent Work:
- **Atari-GPT**: Investigating the capabilities of LLMs as low-level policies in Atari environments. Check out the research [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15950).
- **Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning**: An alternative to traditional preference based reinforcement learning in which users provide ratings to learn a reward model. Read more about it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16348).
- **Optimal Time-Constrained Intercept Guidance**: A project applying deep reinforcement learning to guidance systems. You can explore the paper [here](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-2206).
